Schema.org Specifications
=========================


These specifications allow to enforce the implementation of schemas (see [schema.org][schema]).

Schema properties are optional, for that reason, those specs are not meant to describe the full schemas. Instead, they describe the aspects of the schemas which we believe our own objects should be able to provide and allow to ensure those objects do provide them.

 **Based on** the `1.93 sdo-stantz (2015-02-04)` [Schema.org][releases] release.
